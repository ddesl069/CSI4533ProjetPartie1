# Detection of People from Frame to Frame

## Goal

Compare histograms from people of reference (test) images to all other people in dataset.

## Project Setup

1. Have Python3.12
2. Install all the modules seen at the top of generalized_dynamic_structure.py
3. Delete correlations.txt and results.txt if you want to produce your own versions. The file contents are appended not overriden.
4. Have fun!

> IMPORTANT NOTE: Ignore ALL python files EXCEPT generalized_dynamic_structure.py
>Â Also, ignore correlations_example.txt and results_example.txt, they are old versions of the output files.

## Requirements of project

1. Two Histograms per person
    - Take histogram of (whatever we can see of) the person
    - Take another histogram of the upper half of the first histogram
2. Compararaison
    - Compare an individual's histograms with the histograms of the others 
3. Results:
    - Verify and take notes of accuracy over best 100 results per person (reference histograms).
    So, a total of 500 best results.

## (Rough) Logic

### With the two test images

1 - Draw masks
2 - Make the 2 histograms from them
3 - Compare one person's histograms with other people's histograms to find correlation %

### With all images (dataset)

1 - Draw masks of test images
2 - Make histograms of the 5 people on the test images
3 - Load an image
4 - Compare each of the 5 people of test images to everyone on the image
5 - Repeat 3,4 until done
6 - Pick 100 best results per person (reference histograms) => 5 * 100 = 500
7 - From those 100 best results, manually verify accuracy

## Notes for ourselves
- Normalize histograms
    - Because some histograms' # of pixels will vary a lot with other, skewing the results.
- Can use GrabCut to get rid of background if wanted
